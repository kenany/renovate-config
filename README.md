# @kenan/renovate-config

Renovate config for KenanY projects.

## Usage

Within Renovate's configuration file:

```json
{
  "extends": ["github>kenany/renovate-config"]
}
```

## npm package

This configuration is available as npm package @kenan/renovate-config, but
[npm-hosted presets are now deprecated](https://docs.renovatebot.com/config-presets/#npm-hosted-presets), so this npm package is no longer supported.
